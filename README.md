## Conclusions

![Cluster Analysis](/Images/Cluster_Analysis.png "Radar Chart")

* ### Cluster 0: Relatively young customers, with a high income.
    * #### The customers of this clusters show a high income, with hig product spending and high number of purchase.
    * #### They have a tendency of be single and have no child.
    * #### They do not use the web site and present a moderate seniority.

- ### Cluster 1: Young fathers with low Income.
    - #### The customers in these clusters show low product spending and high web visits, which could indicate that they are interested in purchasing but may not have the financial means to do so.
    - #### They tend to have children and be in a relationship.

    - #### Their average education is a PhD or a Master.

### Based on the radar chart, we can observe that the customers in clusters 0 and 2 are the most valuable. These customers exhibit high spending and frequent purchasing, making them the primary target audience. In particular, customers in cluster 0 show a moderate acceptance of campaign offers, whereas those in cluster 2 are more likely to accept campaign offers.
### On the other hand, customers in clusters 1 and 3 tend to visit the website frequently but they do not make any purchases, likely due to their lower income compared to the other two clusters. To increase their spending, we need more attractive campaign offers.
